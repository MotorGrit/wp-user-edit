== Description ==

Allow site administrators to edit users of their sites in multisite installations.

WP User Edit allows administrators of sites to edit all users who are explicitly members of that site. This plugin is useful if you have an installation type where administrators are trusted to edit the users of their sites, but not trusted to manage an entire network of users.
